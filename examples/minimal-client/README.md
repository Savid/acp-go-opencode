# Minimal Client

This example is a small ACP client that launches `acp-go-opencode` as a
subprocess, initializes the connection, creates a session, and sends one
prompt. It embeds a real `acp.Client` so the agent can read and write files
and request permissions, and it streams the assistant message text back to
stdout.

```sh
go run ./examples/minimal-client "Reply with a short hello from ACP"
```

The prompt is taken from the trailing arguments; when none are given it uses a
default hello prompt. As the turn runs, assistant message text prints as it
streams, followed by the final stop reason. The permission handler accepts the
first allow option and otherwise cancels, so the copied session cannot stall
waiting on input. The program exits when the turn completes. A local `opencode`
CLI must be installed and authenticated.
